# Credit_Risk_Analysis
analyzing customer data to determine credit risk potential

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning to determine the viability of predicting credit risk.  Most loans are "good" loans, meaning - "low risk" with little chance of the borrower defaulting; however, there are still some "high risk" loans, and we want to predict these loans based on a credit data set.
